# CloneGitProfile

A quick Python script to clone your GitHub profiule to a Code folder in your Windows Documents folder

## Usage:
You can either run the script with no arguments:
``python script.py``
or you can add your github username as an argument to make it go faster:
``python script.py anzx42``

## Notes
This should be obvious, but this script requires git. On Windows this can be downloaded from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win). You can install git on Linux distributions with:

* Debian: ``apt install git``
* Arch: ``pacman -Sy git``
* Fedora: ``yum install git-core``
